# 🛡️ OverTheWire Wargames — Cybersecurity Practice Repository

Welcome to my **OverTheWire Wargames** repository!  
This project documents my **hands-on learning journey** through various cybersecurity challenges hosted on [OverTheWire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames).  

Each challenge helps me develop practical knowledge in **Linux, networking, privilege escalation, and ethical hacking** — all while solving real-world-style puzzles.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a strong foundation in **cybersecurity and ethical hacking** by solving OverTheWire’s interactive and skill-based wargames.  
Each level teaches new concepts that improve problem-solving, scripting, and system analysis skills.
